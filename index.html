Technology is one of the sectors that are growing rapidly.

with the advancement in AI and the so called <q> <i> internet of things</i></q> the world has take another direction.
Now of course we base on the positives more than the negatives of this advancement.
Ahhh that is not my concern, lets take a look at some AI advancements.
</p>
<p>
The following are some of the areas i am interested in;
  <ol>

     <li>Coding</li>

 <h3> <center> Artficial Intelligence</center> </h3>
<p>
The world is dynamic , that means its changing. Begining with the evolution of technology
as compared to the 20<sup>th</sup> century.For instance, this has been made significant by the 
advancement in the Ai or<b> Artificial intelligence</b> which has enabled the coming up of <i>machines</i> 
 that <i>think and act like human beings.</i></p>
<p>This has been brought into action by the vigorous effort put in by  th those whom are determined
to make the world a better palace</p>
<p>I would advise you to watch the video below before diving into this theory.
Intelligenceelligence is the capacity the capacity to learn and solve problems
Artificial intelligence is the act of creating machines that act or think humanly.

<p>some of the applications of AI include</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>game playing</li>
<p>Much of the early research in state space search was done using common board games such as checkers, chess, and the 15-puzzle.
Games can generate extremely large search spaces. Theses are large and complex enough to require powerful techniques for determining what alternative to explore
</p>
<li>robotics</li>
<p>
A robot that blindly performs a sequence of actions without responding to changes or being able to detect and correct errors could hardly considered intelligent
It should have some degree of sensors and algorithms to guild it  
</p>
<li>expert systems</li>
<p>One major insight gained from early work in problem solving was the importance of domain-specific knowledge 
Expert knowledge is a combination of a theoretical understanding of the problem and a collection of heuristic problem-solving rules</p>
<li>theorem proving</li>
<p>Theorem-proving is one of the most fruitful branches of the field.
Theorem-proving research was responsible in formalizing search algorithms and developing formal representation languages such as predicate calculus and the logic programming language 
</p>
</ol>
<h3><center> Coding</center></h3>
<p>
Coding is basically programming. It is the act of giving the computer instructions to perform a given task using a certain programming language.
Some of the high level programming languages include java and c++
Java being a more popular language is popularly known by it's ability to run on different machines that is platform independence.
